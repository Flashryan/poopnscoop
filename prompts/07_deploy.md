# Phase 7 — Deploy readiness (Codex)

Implement docs + scripts:
- prisma migrate deploy usage
- Vercel env var documentation
- Vercel Cron retention job route and protection
- Health check endpoint (optional)

DoD:
- README has step-by-step deploy
- Retention job exists and protected with secret


Also ensure Stripe is configured in Vercel env vars and Stripe webhook endpoint is set to /api/webhooks/stripe.
